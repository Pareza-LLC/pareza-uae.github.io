    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    
    <h3>1.1 English, Not Legalese</h3>
    <p>Privacy is important, and we want you to understand the issues involved. We've chosen to use plain English as much as possible to make our terms clear. Some sections still have room for improvement - we plan to tackle these over time.</p>
    
    <p>Where you read 'Daz' it refers to all services made available at <a href="https://dazsuper.com">https://dazsuper.com</a> for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Daz chat app, a DazPay platform which you can use to connect to any server that implements the DazPay protocol;</li>
      <li>The DazPay developer communication app;</li>
      <li>The purchase, provisioning, configuration, monitoring, and management of hosted homeservers and associated services via Daz DazPay Services, or the Daz app store.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Where you read 'homeserver', 'homeservers' or 'the Homeserver', it refers to the services configured within Daz which store the user account and personal conversation history, provide additional functionality such as bots and bridges, and (where enabled by the Customer) communicate via the open DazPay decentralized communication protocol with the public DazPay Network.</p>
    
    <p>When you read 'the Service' in this document, it refers to the Daz chat app instances exposed on <a href="https://dazsuper.com">https://dazsuper.com</a> (or subdomains) by DazPay.</p>
    
    <p>Where you read 'Daz' or 'we' or 'us' below, it refers to Daz, a trading name of DazPay.</p>
    
    <div class="contact-box">
      <p><strong>Daz is the Data Controller for your data.</strong> We can be contacted as per the details below:</p>
      <p>Email: <a href="mailto:info@dazsuper.com">info@dazsuper.com</a></p>
      <p>Postal address:<br>
      Daz Pay<br>
      7 Bell Yard, London, England, WC2A 2JR</p>
      <p>Should you have other questions or concerns about this document, please send us an email at <a href="mailto:info@dazsuper.com">info@dazsuper.com</a></p>
    </div>
    
    <h3>1.2. Scope of This Document</h3>
    <p>This document explains how we process personal data, as it relates to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Daz chat app users:</strong> Daz chat app users use Daz to connect to any server that implements the SCPT Protocol.</li>
      <li><strong>Daz Customers:</strong> Daz Customers use Daz SCPT Services to provision and manage hosted homeservers. Apart from where otherwise noted, this document does not address data protection issues relating to the messaging and file data submitted by Users to the hosted homeserver instances, as this is the legal responsibility of the Customer.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>1.3. The Customer and the User</h3>
    <p>This document is designed to explain Data Protection issues relating to Daz Customers and Users. Put simply, you're a Customer if you're paying (or otherwise compensating) Daz to provide a dedicated hosted messaging service. If you have an account registered on a homeserver that you use to send and receive messages, or use the Daz chat app to connect any server within the SCPT Protocol, you are a User.</p>
    <p>It is possible to be both a Customer and a User, but we encourage you to consider these roles separately when thinking about Data Protection concerns.</p>
    
    <h3>1.4. Changes to This Document</h3>
    <p>Over time, we may make changes to this document. If we make a material change, we will provide the Customer with reasonable notice prior to the change. We will set forth the date upon which the changes will become effective; any use of Daz by the Customer, or any use of a hosted homeserver from SCPT by a User will constitute the Customer's acceptance of these changes.</p>
    <p>Your access and use of Daz are always subject to the most current version of this document.</p>
  </section>

    <h2>2. Access to Your Data</h2>
    
    <h3>2.1. What is the legal basis for processing my data and how does this affect my rights under GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)?</h3>
    
    <h4>2.1.1 Legal Basis for Processing</h4>
    <p>Daz has different legal basis for processing, based on which product you are using:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Daz chat app users:</strong> we collect your IP address when you request access to the Daz client from our web server. This data is collected under Legitimate Interest, to support operational maintenance and to protect against malicious actions against our infrastructure.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>2.1.2. Data Ownership - Messaging and File data within hosted homeservers</h4>
    <p>The Customer can use Daz to provision and manage hosted homeservers. The Customer owns and controls all messages and files submitted to their homeserver by User accounts registered natively on their homeserver. This ownership does not extend to messages and files submitted over federation or bridging.</p>
    <p>This means that, in addition to the usual data access controls defined by the SCPT, all unencrypted messages and files can be accessed by the Customer, and that access is retained even if no User account within the system retains access to the data.</p>
    
    <h4>2.1.3. Your rights as Data Subject</h4>
    <p>You have rights in relation to the personal data we hold about you. Some of these only apply in certain circumstances. Some of these rights are explored in more detail elsewhere in this document. For completeness, your rights under GDPR are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The right to be informed</li>
      <li>The right of access</li>
      <li>The right to rectification</li>
      <li>The right to erasure</li>
      <li>The right to restrict processing</li>
      <li>The right to data portability</li>
      <li>The right to object</li>
      <li>Rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For more information about these rights, please see the guidance provided by the ICO. If you have any questions or are unsure how to exercise your rights, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@dazsuper.com">info@dazspp.cd</a></p>
    
    <h3>2.2 What information do you collect about me and why?</h3>
    <p>The information we collect is for the purpose of supporting your management of hosted homeservers through Daz Services, or to support operational maintenance of the Daz client. We do not profile homeserver Users or their data, but we might profile metadata pertaining to the configuration and management of hosted homeservers so that we can improve our products and services.</p>
    
    <h4>2.2.1 Information you provide to us:</h4>
    <p>We collect information about you when you input it to the Daz or SCPT Services apps or otherwise provide it directly to us.</p>
    
    <h5>Daz Profile Information</h5>
    <p>We collect information when you register for an account. This information is kept to a minimum on purpose, and is restricted to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Email address</li>
      <li>Authentication Identifier; one of:
        <ul>
          <li>Email address and password</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your authentication identifier is used to authenticate your access to Daz at <a href="https://dazsuper.com">https://dazsuper.com</a> and to uniquely identify you.</p>
    <p>You will be given the choice to set up 2-Factor Authentication to secure your account. For 2FA over SMS, we will require your phone number. This information will be shared with a SMS service provider.</p>
    
    <h5>Daz Home Account Setup</h5>
    <p>When setting up an Daz Home account via the setup wizard, we will temporarily access your account data, in order to migrate your existing Daz account to your new Daz Home account. This includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>List of groups you have joined</li>
      <li>Power levels in those groups</li>
      <li>Your avatar</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The setup wizard will also request your OpenID and access token, in order to retrieve your name and verified phone number and/or email address. This information will be temporarily sent to our backend, but will not be retained following your setup completion.</p>
    
    <h4>2.2.2 Information we collect automatically as you use the service:</h4>
    
    <h5>Connection Information</h5>
    <p>We log the IP addresses of everyone who accesses Daz. This data is used in order to mitigate abuse, debug operational issues, and monitor traffic patterns. Our logs are kept for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>180 days, for Daz Super chat app IP addresses;</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h5>Usage Information</h5>
    <p>We track usage data for Daz hosting services. When you are signed in to your account we may track your usage of the site and associate that information with your account details. This data helps us understand how our users are using the application so that we can make improvements to the Service.</p>
    <p>If you are using the Daz chat app, you will be asked to opt-in to this anonymised data collection. Your use of the Service does not rely on your opt-in to this. When using any of the Daz chat clients after opt-in, your visit to the service will be logged, alongside your device ID and agent. This allows us to understand usage patterns based on each platform. The mapping of this data is logged for 28 days - from this point on only aggregated data is kept, for operational and statistical purposes. For further details on our collection and usage of analytics data, please see our Cookie Policy.</p>
    <p>When reporting errors we might collect some information to help us find a solution. This may include your IP address, hostname, full name and email address. This information is collected in the application monitoring platform Sentry and is subject to strict retention policies.</p>
    
    <h5>Location Information</h5>
    <p>We may collect location data on you, if you choose to use the static or live location sharing features within the Daz app. This includes your longitude, altitude and latitude data in order to accurately calculate your precise location.</p>
    <p>Location data is held within the group in which it is shared, so it will be encrypted in encrypted rooms and not encrypted in rooms where encryption is switched off. You will be shown a disclaimer during your first time using this feature, but please apply caution and consideration when sharing your personal data within the app.</p>
    <p>The Daz clients use the third-party service MapTiler to provide the images used to display maps.</p>
    
    <h3>2.3. Sharing Data in Compliance with Enforcement Requests and Applicable Laws; Enforcement of Our Rights</h3>
    <p>In exceptional circumstances, we may share information about you with a third party if we believe that sharing is reasonably necessary to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request,</li>
      <li>Protect the security or integrity of our products and services (e.g. for a security audit),</li>
      <li>Protect Daz and our users from harm or illegal activities, or</li>
      <li>Respond to an emergency which we believe in good faith requires us to disclose information to assist in preventing the serious bodily harm of any person.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>2.4. How do you handle passwords?</h3>
    <p>We never store password data in plain text; instead they are stored hashed (with at least 12 rounds of bcrypt, including both a salt and a server-side pepper secret). Passwords sent to the server are encrypted using SSL.</p>
    <p>It is your sole responsibility to keep your user name, password and other sensitive information confidential. Actions taken using your credentials shall be deemed to be actions taken by you, with all consequences including service termination, civil and criminal penalties.</p>
    <p>If you become aware of any unauthorised use of your account or any other breach of security, you must notify Daz immediately by sending an email to <a href="mailto:info@dazsuper.com">info@dazsuper.com</a>. Users should manage good password hygiene (e.g. using a password manager) and change their password if they believe their account is compromised.</p>
    <p>If you forget your password (and you have registered an email address) you can use the password reset facility to reset it.</p>
    
    <h3>2.5. Our commitment to Children's Privacy</h3>
    <p>We never knowingly collect or maintain information in Daz, through any of the Services provided, from those we know are under 16, and no part of Daz is structured to attract anyone under 16. If you are under 16, please do not use the Service.</p>
    
    <h3>2.6. How can I access or correct my information?</h3>
    <p>If you are a user of the Daz chat app you can request a copy of your data by emailing <a href="mailto:info@dazsuper.com">info@dazsuper.com</a>. We are working on a solution which will allow you to download the data automatically.</p>
    
    <h3>2.7. What are the Guidelines Daz follows when accessing my data?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>We restrict who at Daz (employees and contractors) can access Daz non-encrypted data to roles which require access in order to maintain the health of the Daz apps and services.</li>
      <li>We never share what we see with other users or the general public.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>2.8. Who else has access to my Data?</h3>
    <p>We host the Daz Services on Amazon Web Services (AWS), specifically:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Our admin server is hosted in an AWS data centre in Ireland;</li>
      <li>Our deployment server is hosted in an AWS data centre in Ireland.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Amazon employees may have access to some of this data. Here's <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/privacy/" target="_blank">Amazon's privacy policy</a>. Amazon controls physical access to their locations.</p>
    
    <h3>2.10. How is my Data protected from another user's Data?</h3>
    <p>All of the Daz user data resides within the same dedicated cluster. We use software best practices to guarantee that only the Customer can access it. In other words, we segment User data via software. We do our best and are very confident we're doing a good job at it, but, like every other service that hosts User data on the same database, we cannot guarantee that it is immune to a sophisticated attack.</p>
    
    <h3>2.12. What should I do if I find a security vulnerability in the service?</h3>
    <p>If you have discovered a security concern, please email us at <a href="mailto:security@dazsuper.com">security@dazsuper.com</a>. We'll work with you to make sure that we understand the scope of the issue, and that we fully address your concern. Information security is our highest priority, and we work to address any issues that arise as quickly as possible.</p>
    <p>Please act in good faith towards our users' privacy and data during your disclosure. White hat security researchers are always appreciated.</p>
